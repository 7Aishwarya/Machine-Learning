#fitting multiple linear regression to the training set
We first introduce the multiple linear regressor. We fit it to the training se and then apply predict function on it 
to make predictions of new observations(like test set observations)
for this lm() function is used
regressor = lm(formula = Profit ~ .)
or 
regressor lm(formula = Profit ~ R.D.Spend + Administration + Marketing.Spend + State)

In console when you type summary reressor you will see State2 and State3. these are dummy variables.
Pr(>|t|) :Pvalue
***      :SL(Significance Value)
Less the Pvalue, mor statistically the independent variable will be.
=> Lower the Pvalue higher the effect on independent variable
(Here we are using 5% of Pvalue)
On observing the output of summary(regressorwe see that here R.D.spend has only strong effect on the profit.

This information is highly important for the investors because now they know that they should not only be looking 
at the profit itself to decide where to invest but it should also look at R.D.spend

Thus R.D.spend is the only strong predictor therefore we can rewrite the multiple linear regression equation and 
turn it into simple linear regression equation.
regressor lm(formula = Profit ~ R.D.Spend)


#Bulilding the optimal model using backward elimination
Find a team of independent variables so that each independent variable of the team has great impact on the 
dependent variable, i.e profit. This effect can be positive or negative.
The principle of backward elimination is that we will remove each variable that is statistically not significant
one by one.
