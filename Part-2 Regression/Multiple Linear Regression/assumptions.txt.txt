Assumptions of linear regression
1. Linearity - This means that the mean of the dependent variable is a linear combination of the parameters(regression coefficients) 
   and the predictor variables
2. Homoscedasticity - Homoscedasticity means same variance. 
   Random disturbance in the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables is the same across all values of 
   the independent variables.
3. Multivariate Normality - Multiple regression assumes that the residulas are normally distributred.
4. Independence of Errirs - This means that the distribution of errors is random and not influenced by or correlated to the errors in 
   prior observations.   
5. Lack of Multicollinearity - It is a phenomena in which one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted
   from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy.
