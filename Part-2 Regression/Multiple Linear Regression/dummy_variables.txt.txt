DUMMY VARIABLES

The challange is that the venture capitalist fund wants to see if there is any corelation between profit and the amount that are spent
on different expenses: R&D spend, Administration, marketing and also in which state the company operates.

We have to bulid a linear regression.
We start with 
y=b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + ??
(state is a categorical data therefore it cannot be added to the equation)
x1, x2 and x3 are numeric variables.

Thus whenever you face categorical variable then you need to create dummy variable.

We find all the different categories and for each category create a new column and use 1 or 0 to fill the column 

Profit      R&D      Spend      Admin      Marketing      State      New York      California
                                                          New York       1             0
                                                          California     0             1
                                                          California     0             1
                                                          New York       1             0
                                                          California     0             1
Now ,
y=y=b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b4*D4

This fifth term is for New York. State and California are not included. 
You can never include both dummy variables at the same time. All the data is preserved only if we stick to New York column.

The coefficient for California is going to be included in the constant(b0) and by default when D1=0, this whole equation will
turn into an equation for California. When D1=1 then it means that it is for New York.



DUMMY VARIABLE TRAP

If we use second dummy variable also that would mean that we are duplicating a variable because: D2 = 1 - D1
y=y=b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b4*D4 + b5*D2

The phenomena where one or several independent variables in a linear regression predict another is called 
multiple linearity. As a result of this effect the model cannot distinguish between the facts of D1 from the 
facts of D2 and therefore it won't work properly and this is called the dummy variable trap.
