We have a dataset of 50 companies. For each company there are 5 columns:
column1: amount spend on research and development
column2: spent on administration
column3: marketing
column4: which state it operates in
column5: profit

Now as a data scientist you have to analyze the data set of 50 companies and create a model that will tell 
the venture capitalist fund which types of companies it should invest and their main criteria is profit.

So, profit is the dependent variable and R&D Spend , Administration, Marketing and State are all dependent 
variables.

Formula used for multiple linear regression:
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b4*x4
