Simple Linear Regression
y = b0 + b1*x1 
Multiple Linear Regression
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + .... + bn*xn
Polynomial Linear Regression
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x1^2 + .... + bn*x1^n

We are a human resource team for a big company and we are about to hire a new employee in the company. 
We have to negotiate the new salary for this employee. He is telling he has had 20+ years of experience 
and earned $160K annual salary in his previous company. HR team wants to find out if this information 
given by him is true or not. But unfortunately they manage to get this info only:
positions, their corresponding levels and salary.
They also manage to find that this person who is about to be hired has been a region manager(level 6) 
for 2 years. And it takes 4 years to become a partner(level 7) from a region manager. So according to 
the dataset this person was at level 6.5

Now, as a data scientist we have to build a bluffing detective using regression models to predict if 
this new employee is bluffing about his salary or telling the truth.

We will use polynomial regression to bulid a bluffing detector.
