Random Forest Regression is a version of ‘Ensemble Learning’

Ensemble Learning is when you take multiple algorithms or same algorithms multiple times and put them together to make something much more powerful than the original.

STEP 1 Pick at random ‘k’ data points from the training set.

STEP 2 Build the Decision Tree associated to these ‘k’ data points.

STEP 3 Choose the number Ntree of tress you want to build and repeat STEPS 1 & 2.

STEP 4 For a new data point,make each one of your Ntree tress predict the value of y for the data point in question, and assign the new data point the average across all of the predicted y values.
(means you are getting many predictions and then you take the average of those predictions).
