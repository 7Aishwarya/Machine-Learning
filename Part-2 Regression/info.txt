Suppose you have a data set that contains two columns of a new company:
1. years of experience
2. salary
They have been setting the salary randomly so far based on higher the experience higher the salay.
Now as a data scientist you have to find a corelation between the salary and years of experience.
And then create a simple linear regression model that will tell which is the best fitting line for this relationship.
This will help to set future salaries precisely.

Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continous variables:
-> one variable denoted as x, is regarded as the predictor or independent variable.
-> other valiable denoted as y, is regarded as the response or dependent variable.
Following formula is used:
y = mx + c
m:slope, c:constant
