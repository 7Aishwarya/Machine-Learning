# fitting simple linear regression on to the training set
We create a machine that is a regressor here(simple linear regressor). And we make this machine learn on the training set 
to understand the corelation between the experience and the salary so that this machine based on learning experience can 
then predict the salary w.r.t the experience.

# Predicting the test set results
we create a vector that will contain the predictions of test salaries and we will put all these predicted salaries into 
a single vector(y_pred)
y_pred: vector of predictions for dependent variable <- this will be same for all the machine learning models(that we will create).

# visualizing the test set results
predictions of the test set so thta we can make new pedictions with some new employees having other years of experience and 
that would give us great prediction of salary even if it was not in the original set.
