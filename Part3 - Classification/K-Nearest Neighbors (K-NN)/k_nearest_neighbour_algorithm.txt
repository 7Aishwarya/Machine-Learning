Imagine a scenario where we have 2 categories present in our dataset.

Now, say we are adding a new point to our dataset. The question is it should lie in which category?
How do we classify this new datapoint?
-> Here K-NN Algorithm is used.

How did it do that?

STEP1 -> choose the number k of neighbours

STEP2 -> take the k nearest neighbours of the new data point, according to the Euclidean distance.

STEP3 -> among these k neighbours, count the number of data points in each category.

STEP4 -> Assign the new data point to the category where you counted the most neighbours.

Your model is ready.


#visualizing 
The boundaryin the graph looks like boundary of some state or country. It's because it is based on finding the k closest neighbours 
each time so prediction boundary for the k is most of the times going to look like that.
And compared to logistic regression we can see that this class is much better as it classifies the users into 
their right category as we can see in the graph red points are in the red region while green points are in the green region.

In logistic regression we had a straight line so it could not classify correctly all those green users that correspond to users with 
the age above the average and salary below the average but who bought the SUV, the logistic regression could not catch these users 
in the right category because it was linear.

Besides, we have some wrong predictions because this model did not fit to our model too well. Yet it was a good model.
