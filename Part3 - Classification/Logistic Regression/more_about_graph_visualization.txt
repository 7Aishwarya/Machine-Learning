#visualizing 
we took all the pixels with 0.01 resolution points of this framework and we apply classifier on it.
Each of the pixel points is the user of the social network with a salary and age.
So, for each of these new pixel points these new pixel observation points we apply logistic regression model
to predict if this pixel point has value 0 or 1. If the classifier predicts 0, it's going to colorize the pixel 
point red and if it is 1, it is going to colorize it in green.
