the data set is same as we had in k-means clustering algorithm

##### for python

# spicy
it is an open source python library that contains tools for hierrarchial clustering and building dendrograms
tools - cluster.hierarchy
# sch.linkage
linkage is itself an algorithm o hierarchy clustering
In linkage we specify on which data we apply the linkage

# method = 'ward'
this tries to minize the variance within each cluster

# hc = AgglomerativeClustering(n_cluster = 5, affinity = 'euclidean', linkage = 'ward')
hc is an object of AgglomerativeClustering class
affinity gives the distance to the linkage

# y_hc = hc.fit_predict(X)
y_hc is a vector
fit_predict not only fits agglomerative clustering to our data X but also creates a vector ofclusters that 
returns for each cluster that which cluster the customer belongs to

# visualizing
here visualizing is for only 2 - dimensions
when we map higher dimensions to 2 - dimensions then only we can use this step of visualizing our dataset


##### for R

# dendrogram = hclust(dist(X, method = 'euclidean'), method = 'ward.D')
dendrogram here is a variable
hclust is a class
hierarchial cluster analysis on a set of dissimilarities and methods for analyzing it 

y_hc = cutree(hc, 5
y_hc is a vector of clusters that tells which cluster each customer belongs to
cutree is a method for this
