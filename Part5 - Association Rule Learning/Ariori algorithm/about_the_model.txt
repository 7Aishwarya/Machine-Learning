# about the dataset
There are 7500 observations, 20 variables



############ For R ########################

# header = FALSE
to indicate that the first line of our data set does not contain titles of the columns

We are making this apriori model for a store and we want to ind out the association rules of the different products of the store
to see how the manager of the store can optimize the placement of its different products to optimize the sales. 

The manager of the store noticed and calculated that on an average each customer goes and buys at the store once a week.

package used - 'arules' package
it does not use dataset like we have, it uses sparse matrix as input (matrix that contains lots of zeros)
So, we convert our dataset to sparse matrix.

120 columns for 120 products
rows correspond to the transactions of 7500 customers 
0 -> if product is not there
1 -> i product is there

# rm.duplicates = TRUE 
to remove duplicates

# sep = ','
different products are seperated by a comma when you open a text editor

# summary(dataset)

frequency plot of the different products bought by the different customers in the store during this whole week. To get this plot 
easily we use one of the function itemFrequencyPlot() of the 'arules' package

# itemFrequencyPlot(dataset, topN = 10)
topN - number of most sold products you want to have in this frequency plot

# training apriori on the dataset
we have to set a minimum support. We are going to consider a product that is purchased 3 or 4 times a day and tehn by associating 
them and placing them together customers are more likely to purchase these products. Therefore the sales will increase and that will  
be the starting point of how we are going to set our minimum support.
And if we are not convinced by the rules we'll change this value of the support, that's how we work with the apriori model.
We try different values of support and confidence until we get the strongest rules that optimizes the sales.

if a product is purchased 3 times a day, it means it is bought 3*7=21 times a week
and since support = no. of transactions of this product / total no. of transactions
          support = (3*7) / 7500 = 0.003

choice of support depends on business problem but mostly on business goals so we are going to start with the default value of confidence
and then decrease the confidence step by step untill we get some relevant rules.

if confidence:
too high -> obvious rules
too low -> nonsense rules
therefore it should not be too high and not too low

# visualizing the results
lift is the best metric to measure the relevance of the rules that is why we are sorting the rules that is why we are sorting the rules 
by their confidence or support
-> inspect() used for ths purpose

# inspect(rules[1:10])
this will give only the irst 10 rules found by our apriori model (and not the 10 rules having the highest lift). Therefore we sort.



############## For Python #######################

# min_confidence = 0.2
all the rules we have must be true atleast 20% of the times

=> Here the rules found by the apriori algorithm are already sortedby their relevance . So, relevance is not the lift, it's actually the 
combination of support, confidence and the lift.


we are going to import apriory function from this python file(that contains classes and functions) instead of importing some classes and 
functions from an open source library.
